## General Info
In this project, I made a simple news application with the data I pulled from newsapi.org. 
In this application, which can also store the news locally, it is aimed to facilitate access to the news.

## How to Use
On the first page, news sources are listed and a floating actionbutton is located at the bottom. 
Here, we can view the news in that news source by clicking on the news source we want, 
or we can view our recorded data by clicking the floatingactionbutton.
If we click on the news source, news from that news source will appear. On this detail page, 
we can also search and search for news if we wish. 
A floatingactionbutton is located at the bottom of the page and does the same action as on the homepage.
